# MARLenvironments
Multi-Agent environments for [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym).

# Installation
To install, use `pip install -e git+https://github.com/LuggiStruggi/MARLenvironments#egg=MARLenvs`.
Then just `import gym` & `Ã¬mport MARLenvs`.

### Requires:
  - gym
  - numpy
  - python version >= 3.9

# Environments

## Two-Step Environment
Very simple tabular environment which appears in [QMIX: Monotonic Value Function Factorisation for Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11485). First agent decides which out of two games to play. The agents then pick an action (0 or 1) for the one-round game and receive a shared reward.

`env = gym.make('TwoStep-v0')`

## Switch-Corridor Environment
This environment appears in [Value-Decomposition Networks For Cooperative
Multi-Agent Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05296.pdf). Two agents try to reach a switch in the other room but can't fit through the corridor simultaneously. They observe their environment only partially through a maximum-range view.
